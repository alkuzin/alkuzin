## Embedded Systems Engineer | Robotics & Navigation

I design and implement reliable software for **autonomous systems**, **inertial navigation (IMU/AHRS)**, and **low-level OS architecture**.
My focus is on bridging the gap between hardware constraints and high-level algorithmic requirements.

### 🚀 Key Projects

---

#### 📡 [Inertial Navigation Data Transfer Protocol (INDTP)](https://github.com/alkuzin/indtp) | `Embedded`, `Rust`

**Lightweight, binary application-layer (L7) protocol designed specifically for the Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and autonomous platforms.**

INDTP addresses the critical trade-off between low-latency real-time data streaming, robustness against the noise, and cryptographic security. The protocol features a compact fixed size header, support for data aggregation in order to minimize overhead at high sampling rates, and a flexible multimode security architecture.

#### 💻 [KFS (Kernel From Scratch)](https://github.com/alkuzin/kfs) | `C++`, `Assembly`, `QEMU`

**Monolithic UNIX-like kernel implementation for educational and architectural deep-dive.**

Implemented the kernel's physical and dynamic memory management subsystems (a custom modification of the **SLAB allocator**).
Wrote drivers for basic peripherals, a **graphics subsystem** with an integrated font, processor exception handlers, hardware and software interrupts, and a kernel panic mechanism.
Wrote a **simplified standard library (libc)** for the kernel and an interactive command shell with support for several built-in commands.
